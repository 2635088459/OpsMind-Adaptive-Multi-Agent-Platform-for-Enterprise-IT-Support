## Persistence

- Persist only owned user mappings, role assignments, session/revocation metadata, step-up challenges, audit, outbox, and processed events.
- Sensitive columns use encryption or irreversible hashes; tokens and credentials are never stored.
- State transitions and audit/outbox commit in one database transaction.
- Migrations are forward-safe and repeatably verified with retention/deletion rules.
