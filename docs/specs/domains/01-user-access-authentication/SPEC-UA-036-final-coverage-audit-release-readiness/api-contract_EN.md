## API Contract

- APIs use versioned paths or media types.
- Protected endpoints require a verified principal and server-side permission/resource-scope checks.
- Commands require a correlation ID and idempotency key; security errors do not reveal token-validation internals.
- Internal service calls use workload identity and reject client-forged role headers.
