Concrete objective: Exercise outages, disk/cardinality/backlog/drop with business fail-open, RTO/RPO, and recovery.

Source configuration lives in Git; metrics use Prometheus WAL/TSDB, logs use Loki index/chunks, and traces use Tempo blocks. The implementation documents storage class/PVC or object storage, capacity formula, retention, compaction, encryption, backup/restore, deletion evidence and disk-full behavior. Telemetry stores are never authoritative business databases.
