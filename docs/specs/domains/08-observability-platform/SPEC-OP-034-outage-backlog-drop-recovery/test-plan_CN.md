本规格的具体目标：演练 Collector/backend/network/disk 故障、cardinality explosion、积压/丢弃，定义业务 fail-open、RTO/RPO 与恢复。

1. Lint YAML/Jsonnet/Helm/Compose/Kubernetes and component config.
2. Run schema plus signal-contract tests against Java and Python fixtures.
3. Validate PromQL with promtool and execute relevant LogQL/TraceQL/dashboard queries.
4. Start isolated Compose/Testcontainers topology and assert ingestion, query, correlation and auth.
5. Run load/cardinality/queue/storage tests and secret/PII leak scans.
6. Inject component/network/disk failure; verify bounded loss, metrics, alerts, recovery and rollback.
7. Save commands, versions, screenshots/query outputs and pass/fail evidence in traceability.
