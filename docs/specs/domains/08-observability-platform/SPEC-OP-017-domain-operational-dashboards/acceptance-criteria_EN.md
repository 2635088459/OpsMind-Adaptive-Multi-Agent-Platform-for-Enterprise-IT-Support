Concrete objective: Deliver owner-specific dashboards for domains 01–07 covering lifecycle, errors, backlog, and audit.

- Configuration validates and deploys reproducibly in local/CI and the documented production topology.
- A real producer signal is ingested, queried and correlated with expected fields.
- Resource, port, volume, retention, authentication and health behavior are evidenced.
- Dependency outage, retry, overload, drop and rollback paths are repeatable and do not block business.
- Secret/PII scan and cardinality budget pass; dashboard/rule/runbook has owner and version.
- Traceability records exact files, commands, results and residual risks.
