# Signal and Event Contract — SPEC-OP-017

> Domain: 08-observability-platform
> Phase: `phase-04-dashboards-correlation-analysis`
> Status: planned
> Deployables: OTel Collector / Prometheus / Loki / Tempo / Grafana / Alertmanager

Concrete objective: Deliver owner-specific dashboards for domains 01–07 covering lifecycle, errors, backlog, and audit.

Every signal carries service.name/version, deployment.environment, timestamp and trace/correlation linkage where applicable. HTTP and AMQP use W3C context. Alert notifications carry alertname, severity, owner, environment, startsAt, fingerprint, dashboard and runbook. Schema changes are additive or versioned; secret/PII and high-cardinality attributes are rejected or removed before export.
