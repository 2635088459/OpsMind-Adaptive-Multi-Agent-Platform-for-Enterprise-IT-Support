Concrete objective: Deploy OTLP gRPC/HTTP gateway with TLS/auth, health 13133, metrics 8888, and readiness.

- Signals are immutable observations and preserve source-domain ownership.
- Configuration is versioned per environment and changed through review.
- Business availability takes priority over telemetry delivery; failure is bounded and measured.
- Every artifact declares owner, version, access policy, retention, runbook, rollback and audit reference.
- Tokens, credentials, raw prompts/user text and unredacted PII are forbidden.
