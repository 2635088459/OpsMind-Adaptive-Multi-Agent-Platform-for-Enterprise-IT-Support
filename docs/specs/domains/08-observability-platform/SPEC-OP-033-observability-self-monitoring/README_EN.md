## Goal

Concrete objective: Self-monitor ingestion, drops, queues, storage, queries, notifications, and synthetic probes.

## Deliverables

- Version-pinned configuration and environment overlays.
- Deployment manifest with image, ports, health/readiness, CPU/memory, volume and network policy.
- Signal/query/dashboard/rule/runbook artifacts applicable to this objective.
- Security, failure/recovery, rollback, operational and traceability evidence.

## Non-goals

No business-state mutation, custom telemetry backend, raw secret/PII ingestion, or unbounded metric labels.
