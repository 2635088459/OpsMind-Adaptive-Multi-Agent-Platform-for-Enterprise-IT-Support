> Domain: 08-observability-platform
> Phase: `phase-01-unified-signal-contracts`
> Status: planned
> Deployables: OTel Collector / Prometheus / Loki / Tempo / Grafana / Alertmanager

本规格的具体目标：实现 W3C traceparent/tracestate/baggage 在 HTTP 与 RabbitMQ publish/consume 的注入提取，禁止敏感 baggage。

Every signal carries service.name/version, deployment.environment, timestamp and trace/correlation linkage where applicable. HTTP and AMQP use W3C context. Alert notifications carry alertname, severity, owner, environment, startsAt, fingerprint, dashboard and runbook. Schema changes are additive or versioned; secret/PII and high-cardinality attributes are rejected or removed before export.
