# Persistence and Deployment — SPEC-OP-001

> Domain: 08-observability-platform
> Phase: `phase-00-platform-engineering-foundation`
> Status: planned
> Deployables: OTel Collector / Prometheus / Loki / Tempo / Grafana / Alertmanager

Concrete objective: Define data/control-plane ownership, forbidden business writes, component responsibility matrix, and ADRs.

Source configuration lives in Git; metrics use Prometheus WAL/TSDB, logs use Loki index/chunks, and traces use Tempo blocks. The implementation documents storage class/PVC or object storage, capacity formula, retention, compaction, encryption, backup/restore, deletion evidence and disk-full behavior. Telemetry stores are never authoritative business databases.
