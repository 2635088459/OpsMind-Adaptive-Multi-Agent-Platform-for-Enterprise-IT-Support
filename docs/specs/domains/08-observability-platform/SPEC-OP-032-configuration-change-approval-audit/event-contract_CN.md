Every signal carries service.name/version, deployment.environment, timestamp and trace/correlation linkage where applicable. HTTP and AMQP use W3C context. Alert notifications carry alertname, severity, owner, environment, startsAt, fingerprint, dashboard and runbook. Schema changes are additive or versioned; secret/PII and high-cardinality attributes are rejected or removed before export.
