Concrete objective: Run full Identity/MFA trace across domains and transports with dashboard/alert/runbook/chaos verification.

- Signals are immutable observations and preserve source-domain ownership.
- Configuration is versioned per environment and changed through review.
- Business availability takes priority over telemetry delivery; failure is bounded and measured.
- Every artifact declares owner, version, access policy, retention, runbook, rollback and audit reference.
- Tokens, credentials, raw prompts/user text and unredacted PII are forbidden.
